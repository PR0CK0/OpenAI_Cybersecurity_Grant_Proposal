### Requested funding
First, we request a monetary amount of $714.08 USD to obtain access to the four selected ISO/IEC standard documents. Additionally, we request the remainder of the stated maximum allowance for the OpenAI Cybersecurity Grant: $10,000 worth of API credits (or equivalent). Given the price of the requested ISO/IEC standard document, this amounts to $9,285.92 in token credits. The token credits will be directly used in the project with GPT-4. The requested funding is the stated maximum increment, because of the price of GPT-4, in addition to the fact that the documents being parsed often exceed 50 pages in length, so API credits will be expended rapidly. If OpenAI's advancement allows it, we would also like to access GPT-4's 32k context model, to allow better ingestion of large standard documents. This would accelerate token use considerably. So saying, we request OpenAIâ€™s stated maximum funding increment of $10,000 in equivalent value.


### Timeline
* July 2023 - Fine-grained survey of the research landscape, particularly on cybersecurity requirements and other cybersecurity standards/bodies of knowledge
* August 2023 - Parsing of selected standard documents, baseline cybersecurity knowledge evaluations of GPT-4 prompting
* September 2023 - Definition of "good" or baseline cybersecurity requirements, and preliminary tests with GPT-4 in generating requirements without provided standards (zero-shot prompting) to obtain performance baselines
* October 2023 - Formation of API interface and file system management; begin experimental prompts with standard documents
* November 2023 - Experimental prompting, data collection and results analysis
* December 2023 - Further experimental prompting, preliminary writeup
* January 2024 - Final writeup and submission to publication outlet
* February 2024 - Publication deliberation, feedback
* March 2024 - Final submission, travel and presentation
