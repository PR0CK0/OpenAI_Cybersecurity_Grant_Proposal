# OpenAI Cybersecurity Grant Proposal
Repo for all docs pertaining to our proposal for [OpenAI's cybersecurity grant program](https://openai.com/blog/openai-cybersecurity-grant-program).

```yaml
Title: From Legacy to Compliant: ChatGPT's Role in Aligning Cybersecurity Requirements to ISO Standards

Principal author: Tyler Procko
ML expert: Timothy Elvira
Advisor: Omar Ochoa

Proposed completion date: 01/31/2024

### Requested funding
* Direct monetary funding should not be needed; but GPT credits will be.
* With the price of GPT-4, we would request $10,000 worth of API credits. 

### Justification of funding
The funds (token credits) will be directly used in the project with GPT-4. The requested funding is the stated maximum increment, because of the price of GPT-4, in addition to the fact that the documents being parsed often exceed 50 pages in length, so API credits will be expended rapidly. If OpenAI's advancement allows it, we would also like to access GPT-4's 32k context model, to allow better ingestion of large standards documents; this would accelerate token use considerably. So saying, we request the maximum increment of $10,000 worth of API credits.

### Timeline
* July 2023 - Fine-grained survey of the research landscape, particularly on cybersecurity requirements and cybersecurity standards/bodies of knowledge
* August 2023 - Collection, storage and parsing of selected standards documents
* September 2023 - Definition of "good" or baseline cybersecurity requirements, and preliminary tests with GPT-4 in generating requirements without provided standards (zero-shot prompting) to obtain baselines of performance
* October 2023 - Formation of API interface and file system management; begin experimental prompts with standards documents
* November 2023 - Experimental prompting, data collection and results analysis
* December 2023 - Further experimental prompting, preliminary writeup
* January 2023 - Final writeup and dissemination
